I am really grateful for the opportunity to attend the [IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition 2023 (CVPR)](https://cvpr2023.thecvf.com/) in Vancouver. Thanks to my two student travel awards from SRUK/CERU and [AI for Content Creation (AI4CC) Workshop](https://ai4cc.net/) at CVPR23.

CVPR is the largest conference in computer vision, and it's a unique event to discover the latest advances in the field. As well as offering a great forum to meet old friends and colleagues, as well as making new connections.

I was also lucky to be able to present my [BMVC](https://bmvc2022.org/) work on Sparse View Synthesis at the AI4CC workshop.
