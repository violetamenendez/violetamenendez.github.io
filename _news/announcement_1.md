I presented my paper *"SaiNet: Stereo aware inpainting behind objects with generative networks"* at the [AI for Content Creation](https://ai4cc.net/2022/) workshop at [The IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition 2022](https://cvpr2022.thecvf.com/) in New Orleans. It was my first time at CVPR and it was an amazing experience where I got to meet so many interesting people working on the last state-of-the-art in the field. I was overwhelmed by the size of the conference and the impact that this field has in modern society with so many cool applications!

My [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07014) applies multi-camera consistent techniques to stereoscopic images to be able to inpaint disocclusion areas with stereo-consistent content.
