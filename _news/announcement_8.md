I was lucky to be able to attend the [34th British Machine Vision Conference](https://bmvc2023.org/) in Aberdeen, and publish my paper at the [1st Workshop in Video Understanding and its Applications](https://vua-bmvc.github.io/2023/).

I had the opportunity to give a talk about my paper [ZeST-NeRF: Using temporal aggregation for Zero-Shot Temporal NeRFs](https://workshops.proceedings.bmvc2023.org/The1stWorkshopinVideoUnderstandinganditsApplications/2/CameraReady/CRC_VUA_BMVC_2023.pdf).

The British Machine Vision Conference (BMVC) is the British Machine Vision Associationâ€™s (BMVA) annual conference on machine vision, image processing, and pattern recognition. It is one of the major international conferences on computer vision and related areas held in the UK. With increasing popularity and quality, it has established itself as a prestigious event on the vision calendar.
