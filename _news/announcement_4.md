I presented my latest paper on sparse view synthesis at BMVC :nerd_face:

<p align="center"><img src="/assets/img/bmvc_poster.jpg" width=700></p>

I was very lucky to be able to publish my paper and present my poster at [The 33rd British Machine Vision Conference in London](https://bmvc2022.org/). I got to meet a lot of nice and intelligent people, and share our research experiences and knowledge. We also tried a lot of interesting restaurants in London (how many DL researchers do you need to figure out the bill?).

You can see my paper, poster, and video presentation at the conference proceedings [here](https://bmvc2022.mpi-inf.mpg.de/886/) and the published code in my [GitHub](https://github.com/violetamenendez/svs-sparse-novel-view).
