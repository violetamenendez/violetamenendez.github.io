I am a mathematician specialised in computer science and programming. Particularly interested in projects that involve applied mathematics, machine learning, Linux and open source, and basically any exciting project that helps me develop my skills as a computer scientist.

I am currently working towards a PhD in Computer Vision applied to Media Production. My topic is Generating Virtual Camera Views Using Generative Networks. You can find my publications here: [publications page](/al-folio/publications/).
