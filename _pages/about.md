I am a Senior Research Software Engineer at the [CoSTAR National Lab](https://www.ukri.org/councils/ahrc/remit-programmes-and-priorities/convergent-screen-technologies-and-performance-in-realtime-costar/costar-national-lab/), part of [CVSSP](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/centre-vision-speech-signal-processing) at the [University of Surrey](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/people/violeta-menendez-gonzalez). I have a strong background in computer vision, deep learning, and mathematics, with a passion for Linux, open-source projects, and developing innovative solutions to complex technical problems.

I successfully completed my PhD in Computer Vision applied to Media Production at [CVSSP](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/centre-vision-speech-signal-processing), University of Surrey, in collaboration with [BBC R&D](https://www.bbc.co.uk/rd). My research focused on Generating Virtual Camera Views Using Generative Networks, and I am experienced in deep learning inpainting techniques, generative adversarial networks, novel view synthesis approaches, NeRF, Gaussian Splatting, and more. You can find my publications [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=sle-D7AAAAAJ&hl=en&authuser=2&oi=ao).

I am a firm believer in open and reproducible science as a cornerstone for future research and building trust in the scientific community. As a member of the [Surrey Reproducibility Society](https://osf.io/a6xqu/), I organised the [Monthly Mini Hacks (MMH)](https://f1000research.com/collections/minihacks/about-this-collection), which are workshops that bridge open science and coding. These sessions promote best programming practices in research, offer peer-to-peer support for skill development, and provide resources for open collaboration. I gave a talk about our work at the MMH at [FOSDEM 2024](https://archive.fosdem.org/2024/schedule/event/fosdem-2024-3479-from-grassroots-to-standard-practice-how-an-open-science-society-shaped-university-initiatives/). I also help organise the [Open Research Devroom](https://research-fosdem.github.io/) at [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/).

Outside of work, I’m always eager to learn more about life, the universe, and everything, and I really enjoy talking with others about their passions. I love books, films, cooking (and baking for the office!), travelling, languages, and exploring the great outdoors. I am an active [STEM ambassador](https://www.stem.org.uk/) and I served as treasurer for the Surrey [Surrey Scuba Diving Society](https://ussu.co.uk/SubAqua) during my PhD.
