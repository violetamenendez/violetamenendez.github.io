I am a mathematician specialised in computer science and programming. I am particularly interested in projects that involve applied mathematics, machine learning, Linux and open source, and basically any exciting project that helps me develop my skills as a computer scientist.

I am currently working towards a PhD in Computer Vision applied to Media Production at [CVSSP](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/centre-vision-speech-signal-processing) (University of Surrey) with [BBC R&D](https://www.bbc.co.uk/rd). My topic is *Generating Virtual Camera Views Using Generative Networks*. I am familiar with deep learning inpainting techniques, generative adversarial networks, novel view synthesis approaches, NeRF, etc. You can find my publications [here](/publications/).

I believe open and reproducible science is really important for the future of research and for trust in science. I am a member of the [Surrey Reproducibility Society](https://osf.io/a6xqu/), and as part of this initiative I run the [Monthly Mini Hacks](https://f1000research.com/collections/minihacks/about-this-collection). These are monthly [workshops](https://www.eventbrite.com/manage/collections/440659/events) that promote the intersection between open science and coding. We aim to cultivate best programming practices in research and to provide peer-to-peer support for learning new skills and abilities, and we also share all our [resources](https://osf.io/wbupr/) to facilitate open collaboration. We are always looking for new people for long-term collaborations, one-time talks (you don't need to be an expert!), or just to join us to see what others have to say. Feel free to send me an [email](mailto:v.menendezgonzalez@surrey.ac.uk) or follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MHacksC).

I really enjoy learning new things about life, the universe, and everything, and I love talking with people about what they are passionate about. I really enjoy books, films, cooking (and baking for the office!), travelling, languages, the great outdoors... I am currently the treasurer of the [Surrey Scuba Diving Society](https://ussu.co.uk/SubAqua) and a [STEM ambassador](https://www.stem.org.uk/).
